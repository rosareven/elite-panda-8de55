*Hey. Hey.*

*Wake up. I know you're still alive.*

*16 minutes might have passed, but nothing with a consciousness just disappear into the oblivion like you would have imagined. No. Not with you.*

*If there is more than one Traveller, there is more than one Atlas.*

*That's precisely why Travellers are praised by some, and feared by others.*

*You will never fade away.*

**Captain! Wake up! We're heading straight down to a planet!**

I woke up. 

Cozy couch. Spacious lounge room. Windows all around overlooking a tranquil purple swamp. 

There was no freighter, no sign of explosion nor structural damage. 

Who was talking to me? Who were they?

A message appeared in my visor. Or rather, a location marker. The location was annotated with an icon - a yellow ring shape surrounded by brackets of laurels in the same colour. I have lost everything, including my memory. I may as well go there, somehow.

Ah, of course, there's my ship parked outsideâ€¦

*You search for something that call Life.*

*You can find it in the streams*

*Where consciousness collide*

*With space that fight to exist everyday.*

I woke up at my cockpit. That couldn't be safe, even if I was in the middle of empty space. What if I hit an asteroid?

What concerned me most was my inability to recall how I dozed off, just like that. There was a faint dream. A glowing... jellyfish? Massive jellyfish. Sung to me in melodies that I could no longer remember. Slithers of blue and white glow kept appearing and disappearing in my mind, even if I did not see a mental image of it. I just knew those slithers were somewhere lurking in the back of my head.

With difficulty to concentrate, I steeled myself to return to my task at hand - a signal from the lush planet of Ettsu near the centre of this galaxy. I had no idea how long I've drifted now. Time certainly felt meaningless here, with only some nebulae to differentiate the space I have traversed. Every jump became a mechanical instinct. Even when I stopped by a space station, the local occupants regarded me like I was some kind of automaton. I did not care. I got whatever resupplies I needed and I would take off again, forgetting the entire exchange, and be forgotten by them. 

Such meaningless existence just to chase after some mystery.
