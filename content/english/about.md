I have made many websites in the past, all in one way or another serving various creations I was passionate about at the time. A decade later these websites rose and fell at the rhythm of my mental health, self-confidence and life-being-life in general.

I hope this website is the last I'll ever make, just to leave some semblance of proof to myself that I have at least done some creative work in my lifetime, so that I can stop feeling guilty of not getting anything done, when I lay in bed staring into the dark.

Unlike my past websites, this will have *everything* I have ever done, from stories to drawing to game dev to calligraphy, plus any and everything else I have done that have made me smile. I hope they will make you smile too, or feel something - something human and alive.
